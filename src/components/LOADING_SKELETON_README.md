# Account Loading Skeleton Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive loading skeleton for the Account.jsx component that mimics YouTube's design with smooth animations and proper skeleton elements.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. AccountSkeleton.jsx
- **Purpose**: Standalone skeleton component for initial loading state
- **Features**:
  - YouTube-like shimmer animations
  - Staggered animations for grid items
  - Responsive design matching the original layout
  - Profile section skeleton with image, stats, and form elements
  - Blog grid skeleton with 6 placeholder cards

### 2. AccountSkeleton.css
- **Purpose**: Custom CSS animations for enhanced skeleton effects
- **Key Animations**:
  - `shimmer`: Moving gradient effect for skeleton elements
  - `pulse-slow`: Gentle pulsing animation
  - `fade-in-up`: Smooth entrance animation
  - `slide-in-right`: Side entrance animation
  - Staggered delays for grid items (0.1s to 0.6s)

### 3. Account.jsx (Modified)
- **Added Loading States**:
  - `loadingProfile`: Controls profile section loading
  - `initialLoading`: Controls overall initial loading state
  - Enhanced blog grid loading with detailed skeleton cards
- **Features**:
  - Shows full skeleton during initial load
  - Partial loading states for individual sections
  - Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

## Loading States

### 1. Initial Loading
- Shows complete `AccountSkeleton` component
- Displays for 1 second to demonstrate skeleton effect
- Covers both profile and blog sections

### 2. Profile Loading
- Individual skeleton elements for:
  - Profile name
  - Stats (posts, followers, following)
  - Engagement stats (likes, comments)
  - Email address
  - Form fields (for own profile)

### 3. Blog Loading
- Enhanced skeleton cards with:
  - Image placeholder with shimmer effect
  - Title and description placeholders
  - Action buttons skeleton
  - Stats placeholders (likes, comments, date)

## Animation Classes

### Skeleton Element Types
- `.skeleton-shimmer`: Moving gradient effect
- `.skeleton-pulse`: Gentle pulsing animation
- `.skeleton-text`: Text-specific shimmer
- `.skeleton-button`: Button-specific shimmer
- `.skeleton-profile-image`: Profile image shimmer

### Animation Timing
- `.skeleton-fade-in`: 0.6s ease-out
- `.skeleton-slide-in`: 0.4s ease-out
- `.skeleton-item-1` to `.skeleton-item-6`: Staggered delays

## Usage

The skeleton automatically appears when:
1. Component first loads (initial loading)
2. Profile data is being fetched
3. Blog data is being fetched

No additional configuration is needed - the loading states are automatically managed based on API calls.

## Customization

To modify the skeleton appearance:
1. Edit `AccountSkeleton.css` for animation timing and effects
2. Modify skeleton element sizes in `AccountSkeleton.jsx`
3. Adjust loading state logic in `Account.jsx`

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS3 support
- Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design
- CSS animations with fallbacks for older browsers
